                    <h3 class="activity-heading-1 heading-color-adjustment">1. Travel more Sustainabily</h3>
                    <p>Our transportation (cars, trucks, planes etc.) contributes to more than half of the average BC household’s carbon
                      footprint. It also accounts for noxious air pollution, common air contamination, and water toxicity.</p>
                    <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Walk or bike more</h4>
                    <p>In 10 minutes = walking 1 km = biking 3.5 km. In the meantime, you can:<br>
                      • Keep fit (A 125-lb person walking at brisk pace for 30 minutes burns about 150 calories.)<br>
                      • Save money (gym fees or car expenses)<br>
                      • Save time, for short distances (< 10 km), cycling is usually the fastest way to travel in the city</p>
                      <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Take public Transit</h4>
                      <p>Read the news, chat with friends, or take a nap! Taking transit is much cheaper than owning a car: the average
                        savings are $586 per month for a family using public transit instead of driving.</p>
                      <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Carshare or Carpool</h4>
                      <p>It's a great way to bypass traffic congestions (by driving on HOV lane), save expenses and meet new people!</p>

                    <h3 class="activity-heading-1 heading-color-adjustment">2. Reduce Energy Consumption and Increase Renewables</h3>
                    <p>Canada is No. 1 when it comes to energy consumption per capita. We are consuming as much as the continent of
                      Africa, which has double the population of Canada! In BC, energy use accounts for a quarter of the household’s
                      carbon footprint on average.</p>
                    <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Install solar pannels and solar PVs</h4>
                    <p>Rooftop solar – uses photovoltaic cells to harvest the sun energy and convert that into electricity.
                      Solar hot water system – solar thermal collectors circulate a fluid which is heated by the sun’s radiant energy.

                    <p>A Energy Star certified CFL or LED bulb saves up to 30% energy and last 10-25 times longer. A Energy Star certified
                      laundry machine can save 35% energy and water.</p>
                    <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Turn off electronics when you are not in the room</h4>

                    <p>That is equivalent to a 5% reduction in heating energy</p>
                    <h4 class="activity-heading-3 heading-color-adjustment">Seal the heat leaks and insulate your home</h4>
                    <p>Check walls, doors, and windows for draft. If you don’t know how, watch this <a href= "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGPg-uxl5qk">video</a>.
                        You can also get a thermal image of your house to identify heat leaks and opportunities for energy efficiency upgrades.
                        What is a thermal image? A thermal image is “a picture of the heat that comes off objects47”.
                        To request a termal image of your home, please contact the City at thermal.imaging@vancouver.ca.
                        Insulate the roof, floors, walls, and the basement to keep your house cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>
