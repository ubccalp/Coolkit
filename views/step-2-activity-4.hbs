                    <h3 class="activity-heading-1 heading-color-adjustment">Assignment:</h3>
                    <p>Gather several colorful markers and satellite photos of your block/yard to map on. Depends on the mapping tools
                    you use, you will need a computer or some hard copies of photos (you can print them on regular paper instead of photo paper.
                    Recommended size: 11" by 17" or 18" by 24")</p>

                    <h3 class="activity-heading-1 heading-color-adjustment">What is Habitat Mapping?</h3>
                    <p>There are many different habitats(other than human habitat) on your block.<br>Here are
                        are some examples of different habitats that you can map in this exercise</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="activity-description heading-color-adjustment">1. "Squirrel Habitat" - Trees & Canopy</h3>
                    <p>Now that you have an idea of how safe it is for squirrels on your block after the Urban Forest Quest, examine
                    all the trees on your neighbourhood map and figure out how much canopy cover you have. The results of urban tree
                    canopies have many important benefits, such as lowering temperatures and reducing store effects.</p>

                    <h3 class="activity-description heading-color-adjustment">2. "Worm Habitat" - Lawns & Soil</h3>
                    <p>These soft surfaces allow water to pass into the ground, reducing the flodding and amount of contaminants entering
                       streams all at once. Soil provides important habitat for many types of underground creatures, and space for trees, plants,
                       and fungi to  grow.</p>

                   <h3 class="activity-description heading-color-adjustment">3. "Car Habitat" - Hard Pavement</h3>
                   <p>Pavement is an impervious surface, which forces stormwater into the sewers or pipes rather than into the soil. This can
                      result in chemicals from the road entering streams and heavy water flow damaging the stream banks. Roads and parking lots
                      also take up a lot of space and increase temperatures.</p>

                   <h4 class="activity-description heading-color-adjustment">4. "Pigeon Habitat" - Buildings & Roofs</h4>
                   <p>These hard surfaces also effect storm water drainage, often directing rainwater straight into the drains and not to the
                      plants which need it during droughts. Roofs can also provide space for solar panel or green roof installation, which can
                      help mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.</p>
